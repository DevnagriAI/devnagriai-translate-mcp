# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# JavaScript MCP Server for Translation Service

## Document Version: 1.0
## Date: May 9, 2025

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for developing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in JavaScript that will provide translation services for Large Language Models (LLMs). The service will specialize in Indic languages, offering both base translations to support LLM accuracy and literal translations.

### 1.2 Scope
The MCP server will enable AI applications and LLMs to access translation capabilities through a standardized interface. It will focus on providing high-quality translation between English and multiple Indic languages, leveraging existing translation APIs while abstracting the complexity for the consuming AI models.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol - A standard protocol for connecting LLMs to external tools and data sources
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **Indic Languages**: Languages native to the Indian subcontinent

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Translation MCP Server will act as a bridge between LLMs and the Devnagri translation API. It will provide translation services via the MCP standard, allowing any MCP-compatible client (such as Claude, GPT in compatible environments, etc.) to access translation capabilities in a standardized way.

### 2.2 Product Features
- Provide translation tools via MCP to supported language models
- Support translation between English and multiple Indic languages
- Offer both literal translations and base translations for LLM enhancement
- Implement proper error handling and rate limiting
- Provide clear documentation for integration

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **AI Application Developers**: Will integrate the MCP server with their AI applications
- **LLM Providers**: May use the translation service to enhance their models' Indic language capabilities
- **End Users**: Will indirectly benefit from improved translations in AI applications

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Tool Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Translation Tool

**Tool Name**: `translate`

**Parameters**:
- `source_text` (string, required): The text to be translated
- `source_language` (string, required): The source language code (e.g., "en")
- `target_language` (string, required): The target language code (e.g., "hi")
- `translation_type` (string, optional): Type of translation requested ("literal" or "base", defaults to "literal")

**Returns**:
- JSON object containing:
  - `translated_text` (string): The translated text
  - `source_language` (string): The source language code
  - `target_language` (string): The target language code
  - `translation_type` (string): The type of translation provided

**Description**:
Translates text from the source language to the target language. When `translation_type` is set to "base", the translation will be optimized for LLM understanding. When set to "literal", it will provide a direct translation of the source text.

#### 3.1.2 Language Detection Tool

**Tool Name**: `detect_language`

**Parameters**:
- `text` (string, required): The text for language detection

**Returns**:
- JSON object containing:
  - `detected_language` (string): The detected language code
  - `confidence_score` (number): Confidence level of detection
  - `supported` (boolean): Whether this language is supported for translation

**Description**:
Detects the language of the provided text. This can be useful for automatically determining the source language for translation.

#### 3.1.3 Supported Languages Tool

**Tool Name**: `list_supported_languages`

**Parameters**:
- None

**Returns**:
- JSON array of language objects, each containing:
  - `name` (string): The language name
  - `native_name` (string): The name of the language in its native script
  - `code` (string): The language code

**Description**:
Returns a list of all supported languages for translation.

### 3.2 Core Functional Requirements

1. The MCP server must handle requests from MCP clients correctly following the MCP specification
2. The server must validate input parameters before sending requests to the translation API
3. The server must properly handle all error cases and return appropriate error messages
4. The server must respect rate limits of the underlying translation API
5. The server must provide accurate translations using the Devnagri API
6. The server should optimize performance to minimize latency

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Architecture

#### 4.1.1 Component Architecture
The server will consist of the following components:
- **MCP Server Core**: Implements the MCP protocol for communication with clients
- **Tool Handlers**: Implements the functional logic for each of the tools
- **API Client**: Manages communication with the Devnagri translation API
- **Validation Layer**: Validates incoming requests
- **Error Handling**: Manages and formats errors

#### 4.1.2 Sequence Flow
1. MCP client sends a request to the MCP server
2. Server validates the request parameters
3. Server forwards the request to the appropriate tool handler
4. Tool handler calls the API client with the necessary parameters
5. API client makes requests to the Devnagri translation API
6. Results are processed and formatted according to the MCP specification
7. Response is sent back to the client

### 4.2 Development Requirements

#### 4.2.1 Development Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js (latest LTS version)
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **MCP SDK**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **Validation**: zod for parameter validation
- **HTTP Client**: axios or node-fetch for API requests
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration testing

#### 4.2.2 External Dependencies
- Devnagri Translation API (https://api.devnagri.com/machine-translation/v2/translate)

#### 4.2.3 Development Best Practices
- Follow MCP specification guidelines for tool development
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write thorough documentation
- Develop with test-driven development (TDD) approach
- Use TypeScript for improved type safety
